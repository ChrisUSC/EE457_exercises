If we wanted to add “space available” and “data available” signals to our design we could wire “space available” to (NOT Full) and “data available” to (NOT empty).
The output for empty or full are mealy style outputs. This is because they are dependant on the input and not just state. In my design I know if the FIFO is full or empty based on a counter of the number of items in the FIFO. These signals are set if the counter == 0 or counter == depth. The counter value is based on the input to the FIFO, so since counter is based on input (wen/ren) and empty and full are based on the counter, then FULL and EMPTY are mealy style outputs.
No, the producer could not just look at FULL to know if the write request was processed. It would also need to know the status of ren (read enable). This is because if the read enable is true when the producer tries to write to a full FIFO, it will be successful, but if the read enable is false when the producer tries to write to the full FIFO, the write will fail. Therefore the producer should look both at the FULL signal as well as the ren.
